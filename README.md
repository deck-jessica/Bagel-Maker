# Bagel-Maker

## Description

This is an application that allows users to create and devour bagels that are persisted to a server. The bagels are accessed via MySQL queries, where the items can be viewed on the page, updated (devoured), or a new item can be created. These requests to the server and being displayed on the page are made possible with the use of MVC organization - models to build or create new instances of the bagel, views of how the data is on the page with the help of handlebars, and the controller which handles the API and MySQL commands.
